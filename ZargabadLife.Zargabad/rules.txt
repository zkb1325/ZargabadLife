General Rules:
Taking advantage of any bugs or glitches will result in a kick or ban.
No trolling or being a nuisance to other players such as knocking a player out over and over, standing in front of another players vehicle to block them, or Running in front of other player driving so they run you over.
Illegal Workers/Slaves are only illegal if they are within a workplace.
Don't confuse Laws and Rules. Laws that are broken are punishable by jail time while Rules are punishable by an Admin's decision.
Laws could conflict with rules and should be brought to an Admin's attention. For example: "All weapons are illegal, Anyone seen with a weapon should be shot.".
Civs are not allowed to enter Cop Base.
Cops are not allowed to enter Terror Hideout.

New Life Rule:
There is no "New Life Rule", you are allowed to go back where you died and continue what you were doing.
While there is no "New Life Rule", you are NOT allowed to seek revenge on a killer. The exception to seeking revenge is if a fellow gang member is hunting down your killer.
As a Civ you will only become unWanted if killed by a cop or arrested.

Terrorism Rules:
Terrorism is not an excuse to kill every player in sight.
Terrorism is a coordinated bombing or an attack on a specific target or location.

Gang Rules:
By default gangs are at war.
You are allowed to kill any enemy gang members on sight ONLY if they are visibly armed.
As long as you are in a gang you are allowed to kill any one you see in a Gang Area whether you own the Gang Area or not.

Cop Rules:
Cop are NOT allowed to use civilian weapons and gear. Cops are only allowed to use the equipment that is available to them at Cop Base.
Cops are allowed to "Camp" drug sellers.
Cops are allowed to "Camp" civ spawn and arrest wanted civilians as they run out, But remember that inside Civ spawn "White Area Marker" is safe from crime and being arrested so cops need to wait for the Civ to run out.

DeathMatching:
Killing other players both Civ and Cop for no reason is considered Random Death Match (RDM).
No RMDing, If you kill another player you better have a good reason for it.
You are allowed to run over other players but you better have a good reason for it or it will be RDM.
When robbing a player make sure you give clear warning for them to stop and time to obey your command before killing them. Don't just say "You running down the road stop" and then kill them 2 seconds later.
