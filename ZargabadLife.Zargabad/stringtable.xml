				<Original>The E key is the interaction key, it's used to open up shop menus and a quick key for getting in and out of unlocked cars. Its also used to interact with other players, it will open up a menu depending if your a civ or cop and if the players hands are up or restrained&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						The L key is used to Lock and Unlock vehicles you have keys to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Being in the driver seat of a vehicle that you have keys to and pressing T will open up the trunk so you can transfer items between you and the vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Tab will toggle your keys on and off, if your keys are off none of the key binds for this life mission will work. For example if your keys are off E wont get in and out of cars or open shops, L won't lock and unlock vehicles, 2 wont open up you inventory. So if for some reason you cant interact with anything make sure your keys are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Press 1 to open menu containing info about your player such as money, weight, deaths, and respawn time. Also that is displayed is the server uptime, factory info, number of players both cop and civ, laws and taxes, and some other useful info.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Press 2 to open up your inventory. On the right of the menu is the list of items you are currently carrying with the amount your carrying next to each item. The use button will use the selected item, drop button will drop the item on the ground, give button will give the item to the selected player. Typing the amount before clicking use, give, or drop will use, give, drop that many items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Pressing 3 will put your hands on your head, use this as a sign of surrender. While your hands are on your head other civs will be able to rob and check your inventory. While cops will be able to restrain, jail, disarm, and search you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Pressing 4 will put your hands down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Pressing 5 will open up the gang menu this is only for civs. In the gang menu you can join, leave, manage, or create a gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Pressing Shift + H will holster your weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						If you are armed with some kind of weapon in hand you can press Shift+F to knock other players out, make sure your close to them first. This is used to rob other players or to restrain them if your a cop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						If you are a cop you can press Tilda (~) to open up a police menu, depending if you are in a vehicle it will open up a bigger menu for cops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						If you are a cop in a vehicle that you have the keys to you can press F to turn the siren on and off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						To rob the bank or a gas station make sure you have a weapon in hand for the option to show up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						If you're in a gang there are 3 gang areas around the map for you to capture. Capturing a gang area has several perks, First is the ability to access a gang shop to get low caliber weapons with out the need for a weapon License. Second is a bonus in your paychecks but note the more people in your gang the less the bonus. Third is the ability to process drugs, each gang area allows you to process a certain drug given that you have the correct License first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Drugs can be bought and used for a trippy effect or can be farmed, processed, and sold for a profit. Note that the drugs MUST be processed in order to sell them, you can't sell unprocessed drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						Remember you need to eat or you will die, food can be bought from gas stations around the map. Different food types feed you different amounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
						If your a cop remember to arrest wanted players. To do so track down the player and either have them put their hands up or stun/knock them out and restrain them. Once done go up to them and press E to open up a menu, Once the menu is open find the slider to set there jail time then click arrest. Remember to arrest them for the appropriate time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
